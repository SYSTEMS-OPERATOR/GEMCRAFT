Below is an example of a complete notebook (suitable for both Google Colab and Kaggle). It will:

- Load the Gemma 3 1B model from Hugging Face.
- Inspect the model architecture (printing module names and shapes) so we catch any surprises.
- Run the STRIPPER process to replace selected nonlinear modules (like GeGLU, RMSNorm, QK-norm) with identity functions.
- Define a “seamless” wrapper that attempts to wrap feed‐forward outputs (by reshaping if possible and applying a toroidal wrap).
- Traverse the model to “seamless‐ify” any candidate feed‑forward blocks.
- Save the resulting model as `SEAMLESS-GEMMA-1B-RAW`.
- Include robust error handling and logging throughout.

You can later use this checkpoint to further experiment with deterministic language reflection and math generators.

# # Seamless Gemma 3 1B STRIPPER Notebook
#
# This notebook performs the following steps:
#
# 1. Loads Google DeepMind's Gemma 3 1B from Hugging Face.
# 2. Inspects the model architecture to verify its structure.
# 3. Replaces nonlinear modules (e.g. GeGLU, RMSNorm, QK-norm) with identity functions ("STRIPPER" step).
# 4. Applies a "seamless" transformation to feed-forward blocks via a custom wrapper.
# 5. Saves the modified model as `SEAMLESS-GEMMA-1B-RAW`.
#
# Error handling is integrated to ensure robust operation and to catch unexpected architecture surprises.

# ## Conclusion
#
# We have:
# - Loaded Gemma 3 1B and inspected its architecture.
# - Applied the STRIPPER process to replace nonlinearities.
# - Wrapped feed-forward blocks with a seamless (toroidal) transformation where possible.
# - Saved the modified model as `SEAMLESS-GEMMA-1B-RAW`.
#
# This checkpoint now contains the refined raw weights in a “pure feed-forward” style.
#
# **Next steps:** Evaluate the model’s deterministic performance on tasks (e.g., discrete division) and
# assess whether the seamless modifications yield the desired efficiency and precision improvements.
#
# Let me know if you need further refinements or additional testing code!
